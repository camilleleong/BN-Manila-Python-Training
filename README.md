#
##### * Push only in your respective branch!
##### * Try not to look at the other branches :see_no_evil: Rather, ask people directly if you need ideas/help
#
#
Assignment Title: `AssignmentX_YourName`
#
#
Make it a habit to have a **docstring at the top of your Codes** (not just within your functions) to explain what the entire thing aims to do.
This is our suggested docstring format:
```
Author: xxx
Date: xxx

What your script does (in brief): xxx

Inputs: xxx
Outputs: xxx
```
#
#
Put a lot of in-line comments as well! It will be easier to check code if people can see what you were actually trying to do. :grin:
#
Happy coding! :snake:
